## Introduction
This repository is the official implementation of Group Position Embedding. Group Position Embedding (GPE) is a novel and efficient technique to enhance the layout understanding ca-pabilities of LLMs without architectural changes or additional pre-training. GPE achieves this by strategically grouping the attention heads and feeding each group with distinct positional embeddings, effectively encoding layout information relevant to document comprehension. For more details, please refer to our paper:

# Dataset Descriptions

**Forms** is an English tabular dataset sourced from Fetaqa.

**Websites** is a Chinese tabular dataset obtained by web crawlers.

**Slides** is a Chinese tabular dataset sourced from PowerPoint. Each cell may have an irregular representation, such as line breaks or complex symbols.

**SynthTables** is our synthetic tabular dataset, derived from entity names and values extracted from public entity extraction datasets. It is randomly rotated and discarded to enhance the difficulty of the task.

**Newspapers** is a Chinese dataset sourced from M6doc newspapers, which contains multiple columns of text information. The layout includes complex information such as horizontal, vertical, and pictures.

**SynthDocs** is our multi-column document dataset generated by SynthDoc, based on public MRC datasets. It disrupts the typography structure of the text, allowing semantically coherent text to be divided into multi-column document layouts.
